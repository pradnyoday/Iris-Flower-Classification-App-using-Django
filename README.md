# Basic-Iris-Flower-Prediction-Webapp-using-Flask
This webapp predicts iris flower species with the help of pre-trained machine learning model. The dataset used to train the model can be found in sklearn datasets library.
The model is then saved in pkl file. Which is imported with the help of joblib.
It it necessary to create a flask environment before running the app.
